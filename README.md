# Uber Data Analysis using R

- With over 118 million users, 5 million drivers, and 6.3 billion trips with 17.4 million trips completed per day - Uber is the company behind the data for moving people and making deliveries hassle-free.
- How are drivers assigned to riders cost-efficiently, and how is dynamic pricing leveraged to balance supply and demand? 
- Thanks to the large volumes of data Uber collects and the fantastic team that handles Uber Data Analysis using Machine Learning tools and frameworks. 
- If you’re curious to learn more about how data analysis is done at Uber to ensure positive experiences for riders while making the ride profitable for the company - Get your hands dirty working with the Uber dataset to gain in-depth insights.


- Data storytelling is an important component of Machine Learning through which companies are able to understand the background of various operations. 
- With the help of visualization, companies can avail the benefit of understanding complex data and gaining insights that would help them to craft decisions. 
- This is more of a data visualization project that will guide you towards using the ggplot2 library for understanding the data and for developing an intuition for understanding the customers who avail the trips.

- In this data analysis, we analyze Uber data from 1th April 2014 to 30th September 2014.

- The goal of this project is to learn visualizations in R.

## We will import the essential packages that we will use in this uber data analysis project:

>### ggplot2
>This is the backbone of this project. ggplot2 is the most popular data visualization library that is most widely used for creating aesthetic visualization plots.

>### ggthemes
>This is more of an add-on to our main ggplot2 library. With this, we can create better create extra themes and scales with the mainstream ggplot2 package.

>### lubridate
>Our dataset involves various time frames. In order to understand our data in separate time categories, we will make use of the lubridate package.

>### dplyr
>This package is the lingua franca of data manipulation in R.

>### tidyr
>This package will help you to tidy your data. The basic principle of tidyr is to tidy the columns where each variable is present in a column, each observation is represented by a row and each value depicts a cell.

>### DT
>With the help of this package, we will be able to interface with the JavaScript Library called – Datatables.

>### scales
>With the help of graphical scales, we can automatically map the data to the correct scales with well-placed axes and legends.
